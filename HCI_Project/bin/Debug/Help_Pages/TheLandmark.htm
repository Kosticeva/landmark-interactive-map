      <a name="data"/>
			<a name="id"/>
			<h4>ID</h4>
				<p>Every landmark is identified with its ID. The Landmark ID is entered
          at the topmost text field on the left side of the dialog. The ID should
          be unique for your landmark. If you enter an ID that is already the ID of
          some other landmark, you will be informed of that when you try to save
          your landmark.</p>

      <a name="name"/>
      <h4>Name</h4>
        <p>Every landmark has to have a name. The name is not unique, and can be
          in any form you like. It is entered at the second text field from the
          top on the left side of the dialog.</p>

      <a name="description"/>
      <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>You can write anything you want about your landmark in its description.
          The description is entered at the third field from the top on the left
          side of the dialog.</p>

      <a name="climate"/>
      <h4>Climate</h4>
        <p>The climate can be Ice cap, Continental, Moderate continental,
          Subtropic, Tropic and Desert. You can choose climate from the
          upper combo-box at the left side of the dialog.</p>

      <a name="tstatus"/>
      <h4>Tourist status</h4>
        <p>The Tourist status can be Exploated, Available and Not available.
          You can choose climate from the lower combo-box at the left side of
          the dialog.</p>

      <a name="revenue"/>
      <h4>Annual revenue</h4>
        <p>The Annual revenue represents amount of money the wonder earns,
          represented in U.S. Dollars. The revenue is entered at the text field
          below the combo-boxes on the left side of the dialog. You can only
          enter digits in this field. If you enter a non-digit, the border
          around the field will turn red as a mark of invalid entry. You
          will not be able to save your landmark if the entered revenue is not valid.</p>

      <a name="info"/>
      <h4>Informations</h4>
        <p>There are 3 check boxes on the dialog, with appropriate statements
          to the left. If you find that the statement is true for your landmark,
          you can check the check box to the right of the statement to mark
          this statement true, and uncheck it to mark the statement false. The
          default state of the check boxes is false.</p>

     <a name="date"/>
     <h4>Date of discovery</h4>
      <p>You can also enter the date your wonder was discovered in the
        date field at the top of the right side of the dialog.</p>
         <p>You can either
        enter the date manually, in which case, you must enter it in the appropriate
        format, which is "dd/mmm/yyyy", where dd is the day of the month, mmm is the
        name of the month, or its three-letter abbreviation, and year is the year
        of the discovery.</p>
        <p> If you want to choose the date from the calendar, you can
        click the calendar icon on the right side of the field and a calendar will
        appear below the field. At first, the current month will appear in the
        calendar, but you can switch between the months of the current year by
        clicking on the arrows at the sides of the calendar to navigate to month
        before and month after, or by clicking the name of the current month and
        choosing the desired month from the list of all months in current year.
        To switch between years, you can click the arrows at the sides of the
        mentioned list of the months, or by clicking at the year number at the
        top and choosing the year from the list of the years in the current decade.
        You can also navigate through the decades by clicking the arrows on the
        sides of the mentioned list of years in the decade.</p>

      <a name="type"></a>
        <h4>Landmark Type</h4>
        <p>Every landmark must have a landmark type. <a href="TheLandmarkType.htm">
          Landmark types </a>are created by you and you can <a href="TheLandmarkType.htm#list">
          choose a landmark type</a> or create new landmark type for your landmark by clicking the
          'Choose type' button on the right side of the form, or by pressing the
          <b>Control+Y</b> keys.</p>
					<p> When you select a landmark type, its name will appear
          in the text field above the 'Choose type' button. You cannot enter anything
          in this field, but you can always change the type by clicking 'Choose type'
          button again. If you don't choose a landmark type, you will not be able
          to save your landmark.</p>

      <a name="img"/>
      <h4>Landmark picture</h4>
        <p>Landmarks placed on the map are presented in squares which are filled with
          their picture. You can choose a picture for your landmark by clicking
          the 'Browse' button and choosing a existing image file from the files on
          your device. Selected picture will appear at the left of the 'Browse' button.</p>
        <p>If you have chosen a landmark type, but not the landmark picture,
          the picture of chosen landmark type will be placed as the landmark picture,
          so selecting the picture is not required.</p>

      <a name="tags"></a>
      <h4>Tags</h4>
        <p>Every landmark can have its <a href="TheTag.htm">tags</a>. Tags are not mandatory - you don't have
          to tag your landmark if you don't want to. But if you want to add a tag
          to your landmark, you can do it in two ways. First, you can <a href="TheTag.htm#list">
          choose from existing tags</a> or add a new tag by clicking the 'Manage tags' button at
          the bottom of the right side of the dialog, or by pressing <b>Control+T</b>
					keys.</p>
				<p>If you already know the ID's of your tags, you can enter them manually in
					the landmark window in the text field on the bottom of the right side
					of the dialog. Existing tags are added to your landmark by typing
					the hash ('#') and tag's ID right after it. You can even type multiple tags,
					just be sure to separate them with a single space. If you have entered an invalid
				  tag ID, you will be informed of that right after you leave the field where
					you entered them.</p>
