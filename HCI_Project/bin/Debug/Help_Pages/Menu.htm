	    <h2>All about the Menu</h2>
      <p>All the actions you can perform on the map are placed in the menu.</p>
      <p>The menu contains 4 sections:
        <ol>
          <li><a href="Menu.htm#File">File</a></li>
          <li><a href="Menu.htm#Edit">Edit</a></li>
          <li><a href="Menu.htm#View">View</a></li>
          <li><a href="Menu.htm#Help">Help</a></li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <a name="File"></a>
      <h4>File</h4>
        <p>File section contains 3 items: New, Save and Exit.</p>
        <p><b>New</b> section has 3 options:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>New Landmark - opens dialog for new landmark</li>
            <li>New Landmark Type - opens list of all created landmark types </li>
            <li>New Tag - opens list of all created tags</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          You can use keyboard keys or toolbar options to access each of the <b>New</b> section items.
          <b>Control+L</b> opens the New Landmark dialog (<img src='./../../../Images/17086-200.png'/>),
          <b>Control+Y</b> opens the New Landmark Type dialog (<img src='./../../../Images/type.png'/>)
          and <b>Control+T</b> opens the New Tag dialog (<img src='./../../../Images/tags.png'/>).</p>
        <p><b>Save</b> option saves all the data you created. It can be
          accessed through the menu or pressing the Control+S keys.</p>
        <p><b>Exit</b> option is used to exit the application. When you
          select this option, a dialog will appear and you will need to confirm
          you want to exit. If you confirm and you haven't saved your data, another
          dialog will appear, this time asking you if you would like to save
          your data. If you confirm, your data will be saved and you will exit
          the application. If you cancel, your data won't be saved and you will
          exit the application. You can access this option through the menu
          or pressing the <b>Alt+F4</b> keys.</p>

      <a name="Edit"></a>
      <h4>Edit</h4>
        <p>Exit section contains 5 items: Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete and Find...</p>
        <a name="#Controls"></a>
        <p>Cut, Copy, Paste and Delete are controls used for manipulating
          the placed landmark.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cut option removes the landmark from the map but
          saves its copy on the clipoard. It can be accessed through the menu,
          pressing the <b>Control+X</b> keys or through the toolbar option (<img src='./../../../Images/cut.png'/>).</li>
            <li>Copy option saves the copy of the landmark on the clipboard,
              but leaves the original landmark on the map. It can be accessed
	            through the menu, pressing the <b>Control+C</b> keys or through
	            the toolbar option (<img src='./../../../Images/copy-icon.png'/>).</li>
            <li>Paste option places the copy of the landmark at the selected
              position on the map. You can paste landmarks that you have
              copied with Copy or Cut option. It can be accessed
              through the menu, pressing the <b>Control+V</b> keys or through
              the toolbar option (<img src='./../../../Images/paste.png'/>).</li>
            <li>Delete option removes the landmark from the map. It is not copied
              on the clipboard, but if you have copied it with Copy or Cut options,
              you can place it again on the map. This option only deletes landmark
              image from the map - it doesn't delete the landmark from the database.
              This option can be accessed through the menu, pressing the <b>Delete</b> key or through
              the toolbar option (<img src='./../../../Images/delete1600.png'/>).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To use the Cut, Copy, Paste and Delete command, you must
            first <a href="Map.htm#Select">select</a> the landmark you want to manipulate.</p>
          <a name="List"></a>
          <p>Find... option opens a <a href="Landmark.htm#TheList">dialog</a> with
            all created landmarks from which you can edit, delete or place landmarks
            on the map. You can also find any landmark you want from this dialog.
            Find... option can be opened from the menu, pressing the <b>Control+F</b>
            keys or through the toolbar option (<img src='./../../../Images/list1600.png'/>)</p>

    <a name="Help"></a>
     <h4>View</h4>
      <p>View section has 2 items: Change Map and Toolbar...</p>
      <p>Change Map option opens a dialog where you can select background
        for your map. The selection is not remembered, so the next time you
        log in with your account, the background map will be the default one.</p>
      <p>Toolbar... option opens a menu with one check-box marked 'Visible', and
        two radio butons marked 'Horizontal' and 'Vertical'. Checking the 'Visible'
        check-box places the toolbar on the map. It is placed in the upper left corner
        of the map. It contains 8 options: 3 for creating landmark/landmark type/tag,
        and 5 from the 'Edit' section, used for landmark manipulation and searching
        for landmark. </p><p>Selecting the radio buttons will change toolbar's orientation.
        'Horizontal' will change toolbar's orientation to horizontal, if toolbar's orientation
        until then was vertical and 'Vertical' will change toolbar's orientation from
        horizontal to vertical. You can always hide the toolbar by unchecking the 'Visible'
        check-box. </p>
        <p>You can also <a href="Map.htm#DragDrop">move the toolbar around the map</a>.</p>

      <a name="Help">
      <h4>Help</h4>
        <p>The Help section opens the index page of The Natural Heritage Map helper.
          It can be accessed through the menu or by pressing the <b>Control+H</b>
          keys.</p>
